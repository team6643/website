                The FIRST Lego League Challenge (FLL) is a FIRST program for students ages 9-14. In this program, students are given an "innovation project" prompt that involves the solving of a common issue or obstacle in the community. Students work together to research, plan, and innovate a solution to this real-world problem, which is later presented to a panel of judges. 

                In addition, students are also required to design, build, and program robots using a standard robot set. This robot is then set inside a "gameplay" mat which contains Lego-built missions that the robots are programmed to complete for scoring points. 

                Participating in this program grants students exposure to practical, real-world STEM applications and cooperative skills.
